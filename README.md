## Case Study description:

We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle
Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:
Size = 512x512
The only non transparent pixels are within a circle
That the colors is the badge give a "happy" feeling
Additionally, you can create a parallel function that convert the given image (of any format) into the specified object.

## This repository does not include the functionality of uploading the image via web browser
## It does not include any UI elements for rendering the desired badge
